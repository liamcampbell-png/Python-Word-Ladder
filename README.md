# Python Word Ladder
The game I created starts with my program prompting the user with a 5-
letter source word s and a 5-letter target word t. The user is then required to respond by typing a sequence
of 5-letter words s = w0, w1, w2, . . . , wn−1, wn = t such that all the words in the sequence are valid
5-letter words in the English dictionary are obtained from the previous word by
changing one letter. Thus, the words sequence w0, w1, w2, . . . , wn−1, wn forms a “ladder” from word s to
word t. My program provides the user with an
“easy game” versus a “challenging game” option in my implemented game. The source and target word your program chooses
will depend on the user's chosen option.
